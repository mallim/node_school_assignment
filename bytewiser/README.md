### modifying_buffers
I cannot forget my stream-adventure lessons, so a custom transform stream is used to solve the problem

### line_splitter 
I don't see the point of writing so much code, since I can just use event-stream?

### buffer_concat 
Use event-stream's through method to pipe the buffer
